    <p>
      I started out knitting when I was 7 years old with projects like a baby blanket and a hat for my newborn baby cousin. 
      I was slightly frustrated at the time commitment/output ratio that comes with a tedious task like knitting and was looking 
      for a hobby that would scratch that same itch but would allow me to be able to have a finished product with less time spent... 
      incomes crochet! Crochet is great to satisfy the itch of creating something tangible whether it be small like amigurumi (these little stuffies), 
      or something like a sweater or blanket made of granny squares! I really picked up the pace and started challenging myself with amigurumi when I 
      was a freshman in college. Making these amigurumi has been so fun and my friends love when they receive them as gifts! I have also made things 
      like an oversized cardigan, one that looks like something you might see a grandmother wearing as well as pillows and blankets to decorate my 
      first apartment. Once you learn the basics it is very easy to scale your skills using resources that are available online like tutorials and 
      patterns! Please use the links below to my contact page if you want to learn more about my projects.

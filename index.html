      Hi! I'm Sophia, and I'm a DS4200 student at Northeastern, and when I am not studying, I really 
      love to crochet. I have made a variety of different types of projects over the years This website
       is dedicated to showcasing my previous crochet projects. If you are interested in learning how 
       to crochet, I will also link my contacts down below! I can also direct you to sources online 
       that might be helpful when starting out with crochet/knitting. I know for me personally; I was 
       able to learn best when I saw people showing proper hand posture and tension gauges on the yarn,
       so YouTube videos were most helpful for me. Once I got the hang of things I was able to read 
       patterns that use shorthand and sometimes even symbols to denote stitches especially when you 
       can get the more advanced projects like crochet in the round and when making clothes that have 
       specific size requirements/measurements. For projects like the ones that are shown on the next
       page I recommend getting some extra equipment that can make the process go a lot smoother like
       stitch markers and plastic eye beads for any amigurumi projects. Click the buttons below to 
       navigate to my projects or my contact info.
